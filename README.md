SideQuest is designed to simplify sideloading apps onto your standalone android based headset. It should include everything you need to get started. When you first open the app it is best to open the setup screen and follow the instructions on screen to get set up.

The quest doesnt show 2D apps normally anywhere in the UI. Thankfully though SideQuest has a launcher ( install on the setup screen - scroll down to the bottom ) which appears in the unknown sources list and lets you open 2d apps. You can pick "SideQuest - Home" or "SideQuest - TV" to use the 2D app in the Oculus Home or Oculus TV environments. 

VR apps dont work when launched from the app launcher currently, only 2d apps. The workaround is to launch the VR apps from the unknown sources list instead - they are usually listed there!

## Setup

[Very Important setup instructions - 5 steps and only takes minutes](https://sidequestvr.com/#/setup-howto)

When you first launch SideQuest it will download the repositories and also download the ADB tools. Once this is done you should go to the Setup menu option and follow through the one time setup to get your device ready to install apps.

If you have any problems you can hit the bug icon on the top right and then open the console tab in that section to capture any errors - these will really help to find and fix bugs.

## Important

Check your antivirus hasn't blocked some parts of the ADB download - this has happened for some with Avast antivirus in particular. 


## ChromeBook Setup

Thanks to [u/przecin/](https://www.reddit.com/user/przecin/) for figuring this out!


```bash 
cd SideQuest-0.7.4 # (or the latest version)
chmod u+x sidequest # (applies permissions)
sudo apt-get install libnss3 # (installs libnss3.so library)
./sidequest # (execute)
```


If you get error: "sidequest: sidequest: cannot execute binary file" this means you didn't apply permissions


If you get error ./sidequest: error while loading shared libraries: libnss3.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" this means you need to install libnss3.so


## App Developers:
